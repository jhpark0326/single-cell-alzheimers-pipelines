# AD snRNA-seq multi-model analysis

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq)
analysis pipeline for Alzheimer's disease mouse models using 10x Genomics data.

The analysis integrates multiple AD-related mouse models to:
- perform quality control and preprocessing,
- integrate datasets across batches and conditions,
- identify cell types and subpopulations,
- assess differential expression and network-level changes,
- explore cell–cell communication alterations in disease.

The code is adapted from real research analyses but presented here in a
generalized and reproducible form without raw sequencing data.
