# Title: Regulon analysis (pySCENIC) — loom + AUCell visualization
# Project: AD snRNA-seq multi-model analysis
# Author: Jung Hyun Park
# Purpose: Create a pySCENIC-compatible loom file from exported counts/metadata,
#          then integrate pySCENIC AUCell output for UMAP/tSNE visualization.
# Notes:
#   - Steps 1–3 (GRN + cisTarget) are run via CLI/SLURM; this notebook handles
#     loom creation and downstream visualization.
